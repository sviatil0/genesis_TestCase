### How it is working?

In this project I used CoinBase's API for node.js, to obtain the current information about the spot price of the BTC in UAH. I made a database in the JSON file, in which I am storing the subscribed emails. I am using the nodemailer and Gmail BOT account to send all the information to the emails in a database.

I chose coinbase for it's reputation as a very trustworthy service.
